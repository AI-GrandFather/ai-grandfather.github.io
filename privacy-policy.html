  <h1>Privacy Policy – Block Puzzle Game</h1>
  <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> November 2025</p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile game (“the App”) handles user
    data. The App is developed and published by <strong>[Your Name or Studio Name]</strong>
    (“we”, “us”, “our”). By using the App, you agree to the terms described in this policy.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>

  <h3>1.1 Current Data Collection</h3>
  <p>
    As of the current version of the App:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>We <strong>do not collect any personal data</strong> from users.</li>
    <li>No analytics tools, crash reporting services, or tracking technologies are integrated.</li>
    <li>We do not collect names, email addresses, phone numbers, location data, or device identifiers.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>1.2 In-App Purchases</h3>
  <p>
    The App includes optional in-app purchases. All transactions are processed
    securely through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong>.  
    We do not receive or store any payment or billing information.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>2. Future Data Collection (Ads & Analytics)</h2>
  <p>
    In future updates, we may integrate advertising or analytics services such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>AdMob (Google LLC)</strong> for displaying ads</li>
    <li>Analytics platforms to help improve App performance</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    If these features are added, non-personal device information or usage data
    may be collected automatically by the third-party SDKs.  
    Any such collection will be disclosed in an updated Privacy Policy before it becomes active.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>3. How We Use Information</h2>
  <p>
    If data collection is added in the future, information may be used to:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Serve advertisements</li>
    <li>Monitor App performance</li>
    <li>Fix bugs and improve gameplay</li>
    <li>Enhance user experience</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    We do not sell or share personal information with third parties.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>4. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    The App is suitable for general audiences and does not knowingly collect
    personal information from children under 13.  
    If we learn that a child has submitted personal information, we will delete it immediately.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
  <p>Currently, the App uses only Apple’s in-app purchase system.</p>
  <p>Future versions may use:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>AdMob</li>
    <li>Firebase Analytics</li>
    <li>Other advertising or analytics tools</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Their respective privacy policies will apply when integrated.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>6. Data Storage and Security</h2>
  <p>
    Because we do not collect personal data at this time, we do not store any user information on our servers.  
    If third-party SDKs are added later, they will handle data according to industry-standard security practices.
  </p>

  <hr />

  <h2>7. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time.  
    The “Last Updated” date will reflect the most recent changes.  
    Significant changes may be communicated within the App or in update notes.
  </p>
