        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">📋</span> Overview</h2>
            <p>This Privacy Policy explains how our mobile game ("the App") handles user data. The App is developed and published by <strong>MIAN MUHAMMAD ATHAR</strong> ("we", "us", "our"). By using the App, you agree to the terms described in this policy.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Block Scramble is designed as an offline-first game. Most gameplay happens entirely on your device. However, the App now includes advertisements and in-app purchases that rely on trusted third-party services, which may collect certain device and usage data.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">🛍️</span> In-App Purchases & Subscriptions</h2>
            <p>The App includes optional in-app purchases and subscriptions (for example, premium / ad-free access and in-game items). All transactions are processed securely through the <strong>Apple App Store</strong>.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>We do not receive or store any payment or billing information.</strong> All payment processing is handled entirely by Apple, following their security standards and privacy policies.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">📊</span> Data We Collect</h2>
            <p>We aim to collect as little data as possible. The App itself does not require you to create an account or enter your name, email address, or other contact details.</p>
            <p>However, when you use the App, certain data may be collected automatically by us and our service providers (especially for advertising, analytics, and crash reporting). This may include:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Device identifiers</strong> such as the Advertising ID / IDFA, and other device identifiers used for advertising, security, and fraud prevention.</li>
                <li><strong>Ad-related information</strong> such as which ads are shown, whether an ad is viewed or clicked, and basic information about ad performance.</li>
                <li><strong>Approximate location information</strong> (for example, country or region) that can be inferred from your IP address to help show relevant ads and comply with regional regulations.</li>
                <li><strong>Usage information</strong> such as app launches, time spent in the game, and interactions with certain screens or features, mainly to keep the game stable and to understand overall performance.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>We do not use this information to personally identify you.</strong> Data is used in aggregated or pseudonymous form wherever possible.</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">🎯</span> Advertising, Personalization & Consent</h2>
            <p>The App uses <strong>Google AdMob</strong> and Google’s <strong>User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> to show ads and to manage consent for personalized advertising where required by law.</p>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>Consent screen:</strong> On first launch (and occasionally afterwards if required), you may see a privacy / consent message asking whether you agree to personalized ads. Your choice is stored and can be changed later using your device or system privacy settings.</p>
            </div>
            <p>Depending on your choice:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>If you consent to personalized ads:</strong> AdMob may use your device identifiers, approximate location, and app usage information to show ads that are more relevant to your interests.</li>
                <li><strong>If you do not consent or close the consent dialog:</strong> you will receive <strong>non-personalized ads</strong>. These ads may still be based on general information such as the content of the game or your coarse location (for example, country), but are not tailored using your personal profile.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Even when you choose non-personalized ads, AdMob may still process certain data (such as device identifiers and basic ad-serving information) for purposes such as fraud prevention, reporting, and frequency capping.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">📱</span> IDFA & App Tracking Transparency</h2>
            <p>On iOS, the App may request permission to use the device’s advertising identifier (IDFA) through Apple’s App Tracking Transparency (ATT) framework.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you allow tracking, AdMob may use the IDFA to help deliver and measure personalized ads.</li>
                <li>If you decline, the App will use non-personalized ads and will respect your choice.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>You can change your tracking and advertising preferences at any time in your device’s system privacy settings.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">👶</span> Children's Privacy</h2>
            <p>The App is intended for a general audience and is not specifically directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly request or collect personal information from children under 13.</p>
            <p>If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided personal information through the App, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">🔧</span> Third-Party Services</h2>
            <p>The App may rely on the following third-party services:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Google AdMob & User Messaging Platform (UMP)</strong> – to display ads, manage consent, and determine whether ads are personalized or non-personalized.  
                    See Google’s privacy information here:

                </li>
                <li><strong>Apple In-App Purchases</strong> – to handle payments and subscriptions in a secure way.

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">🔐</span> Data Security</h2>
            <p>We do not operate our own servers for storing your personal information. Game progress and local settings are primarily stored on your device or in Apple’s services (for example, iCloud, if enabled).</p>
            <p>Our third-party partners (such as Google and Apple) use industry-standard security measures to protect the data they process. While no method of transmission or storage is completely secure, we work only with providers that have strong security and compliance practices.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <h2><span class="icon">⚙️</span> Your Choices & Controls</h2>
            <p>Depending on your region and device, you may have the following options:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Respond to the in-app consent dialog to choose between personalized and non-personalized ads.</li>
                <li>Change your device privacy or tracking settings at any time (for example, to reset or limit ad tracking).</li>
                <li>Disable personalized ads from Google in your Google account settings, where available.</li>
            </ul>
